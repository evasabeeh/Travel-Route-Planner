## Specifications

- Optimized travel route plan
- Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Uses Graph data structure
- Flight, train & bus Routes
- Fastest or cheapest preference

## Implementation

- CMake build system used
- Takes two countries as an input
- Generates an .html file displaying the path
- Data for routes and cities are taken through .csv file
- Graph holds location as nodes and routes as edges
- Dijkstra's algorithm determines the shortest path between the origin and destination
